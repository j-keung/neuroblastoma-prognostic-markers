# neuroblastoma-prognostic-markers

The following script analyses a publicly available bulk RNA-seq dataset which can be accessed using the following GEO codes: GSE49711 and GSE62564. GSE62564 is a re-analysis of the GSE49711 dataset, and contains additional clinical data on the same 498 patients in the SEQC cohort. The code concatenates information from the two datasets together, so that survival analysis can be performed to identify and validate prognostic markers.
